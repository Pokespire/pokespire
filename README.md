# Pokespire

A Pok√©mon clone for the TI-Nspire. There's still a lot of work before anything works.

## Compiling

The build system currently depends on [makeheaders](http://www.hwaci.com/sw/mkhdr/), Vogtinator's [ConvertImg](https://github.com/Vogtinator/ConvertImg), as well as GNU Make and the Ndless toolchain.
