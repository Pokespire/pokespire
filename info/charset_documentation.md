#Charset guidelines
## Notice
WalrusROG allows only 254 characters (256 minus `\0` and `\xFF`) per font. While it may not fit for big alphabets or ideogram-based languages, it allows enough data for latin-based languages.

If the charsets are esoteric, a tool should be done to allow encoding and previewing with fonts.

##Preferred charset
On a common point, Windows's version of extended Ascii (ANSI IIRC) provides enough characters (like accents) to cover most latin-based language.
